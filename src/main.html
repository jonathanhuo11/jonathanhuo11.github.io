                I'm an 8th grade student that attends Centennial Public School in Waterloo,
                Ontario (that's a place in Canada, if you don't know). I'm also a part of a small
                developer's team called Symmidium, which is comprised of me,
                <a href="https://www.ethanwhite.xyz">Ethan White</a>,
                Adam Martinez, and <a href="https://alexander-liao.firebaseapp.com/">Alex Liao</a>.
                Together, we've built some cool stuff.

            <p class="w3-xlarge"><b>Okay, but what does he do all day?</b></p>
            <p class="w3-large">
                Well, I go to school, I study math, I program, and I play a lot of video games.
                I can also play the piano (grade 7), the violin (Suzuki 2), and the trombone. Oh, and I play some soccer
                too.

            <p class="w3-large">
                I've been programming for about four and a half years now (I started when I was 9; now I'm 14).
                Over this time, I've gotten to know how to use a variety of languages, API's, frameworks, and tools,
                such as:

                <ul style="width:35% ; margin-left:auto ; margin-right:auto" class="w3-ul w3-center w3-card-4 w3-sand">
                    <li><p class="w3-medium">HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript with Bootstrap, W3.CSS, AnglularJS, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, and more...</p></li>
                    <li><p class="w3-medium">Unity3D, Blender, and Maya</p></li>
                    <li><p class="w3-medium">C# with the .NET framework and MDN tools</p></li>
                    <li><p class="w3-medium">Python with Django and Flask</p></li>
                    <li><p class="w3-medium">Java, C, C++, Swift, Objective-C, Vala, Rust, and more...</p></li>
                    <li><p class="w3-medium">ANTLR 4, YACC, BISON, and GOLD parser generators</p></li>
                    <li><p class="w3-medium">Bash, git, and the Linux system</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="w3-xlarge"><b>Tell me more about what he's done.</b></p>

                In terms of programming, I've built quite a few interesting things.
                <br><br>
                For about two years, I've been developing "indie" games using the Unity3D game engine.
                Some of my projects include a zombie shooter, a 2D physics defying version of sumotori,
                a matrix-style slow-motion fighting game, as well as a multiplayer ragdoll shooter.
                <br><br>
                I'm an experienced web and systems designer. Along with the Symmidium team,
                I've worked on building a browser-based, distributed computation system, called DCNET.
                We envisioned a product that would enable researchers, students, and big companies to
                distribute the work of solving computationally-expensive problems across internet browsers.
                We were able to apply our framework to things like big data processing, solving cryptographic
                hashes, and computing mathematical problems.
                <br><br>
                With a friend, I've built a programming language. During the course of three months, Ethan and I
                constructed a compiler and interpreter for a new language - Slang. We designed this language
                to be familiar to C-style programmers, have the cutting-edge paradigms seen in Swift and Rust,
                and yet maintain a simplicity and elegance like Python. Since it was a part of a school project,
                we also wrote a 40-page essay on compiler construction; bytecode optimizations; and language design.
                Ever since, I've been highly interested in linguistic theory, compiler design, and VM optimizations.
                <br><br>
                I also did some nifty research into complex pathfinding algorithms. I wrote a paper
                about their usages in games (specifically the A* algorithm), as well as optimizations and dynamic
                navigation.
                <br><br>
                Outside of the programming world, I also enjoy studying practical cryptography, mathematics, and music.
                I've done quite a bit of research and development with the TOR browser, and I've also looked into the
                cryptography behind Bitcoin. For a math project in a previous school year, I wrote a 15-page thesis paper that
                examines the role of the Golden Ratio as a crucial aspect of modern and historic artistic composition.
