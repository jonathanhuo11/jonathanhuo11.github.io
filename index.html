            <p class="w3-large" style="text-align:center">
                I'm an 8th grade student that attends Centennial Public School in Waterloo,
                Ontario (that's a place in Canada, if you don't know). I'm also a part of a small
                developer's team called Symmidium, which is comprised of me, Ethan White,
                Adam Martinez, and Alex Liao. Together, we've built some cool stuff.
            </p>

            <p class="w3-xlarge" style="text-align:center"><b>What does this guy do?</b></p>
            <p class="w3-large" style="text-align:center">
                Well, I go to school, I study math, I program, and I play a lot of video games.
                I can also play the piano, the violin, and the trombone. Oh, and I play some soccer
                too.
            </p>

            <p class="w3-xlarge" style="text-align:center"><b>What does this guy know?</b></p>
            <p class="w3-large" style="text-align:center">
                I've been programming for about four and a half years now (I started when I was 9; now I'm 14).
                Over this time, I've gotten to know how to use a variety of languages, API's, frameworks, and tools.
            </p>

            <p class="w3-xlarge" style="text-align:center"><b>What are some things this guy has done?</b></p>
            <p class="w3-large" style="text-align:center">
                In terms of programming, I've built quite a few interesting doohickeys.
                <br><br>
                For about two years, I've been developing "indie" games using the Unity3D game engine.
                Some of my projects include a zombie shooter, a 2D physics defying version of sumotori,
                a matrix-style slow-motion fighting game, as well as a multiplayer ragdoll shooter.
                <br><br>
                I'm also an experienced web and systems designer. Along with the Symmidium team,
                I've worked on building a browser-based, distributed computation system, called DCNET.
                We envisioned a product that would enable researchers, students, and big companies to
                distribute the work of solving computationally-expensive problems across internet browsers.
                We were able to apply our framework to things like big data processing, solving cryptographic
                hashes, and computing mathematical problems.
                <br><br>
                I've also built my own programming language. During the course of three months, Ethan and I
                constructed a compiler and interpreter for a new language - Slang. We designed this language
                to be familiar to C-style programmers, have the cutting-edge paradigms seen in Swift and Rust,
                and yet maintain a simplicity and elegance like Python. Since it was a part of a school project,
                we also wrote a 40-page essay on compiler construction; bytecode optimizations; and language design.
